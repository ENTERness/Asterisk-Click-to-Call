# Asterisk Click-to-Call (PHP)
Asterisk-Click-to-Call project is a simple and pure PHP script to send a click-to-call signal across Asterisk Server using any browser.

## Dependencies
This script don't depends any JavaScript or Php Library to work. Just need the right values of your Asterisk Server.

## How does it work?
Before anything, you must set you IP server, port and an username that already've been created into your Asterisk. After, the script will open a Socket to try autenticate in your server. If tha autenticate occured without problens, thh script send a Click-to-Call for the number setted in the code.

I really hope it help you!
Good Luck!
